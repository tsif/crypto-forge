# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Philosophy

CryptoForge is designed with security as a primary concern:

- **Client-Side Only**: All cryptographic operations run locally in your browser using the Web Crypto API
- **No Data Transmission**: No keys, certificates, or sensitive data are sent to any server
- **No Storage**: No data is persisted beyond your browser session
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly auditable

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the repository maintainer with:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the resolution process
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data without explicit permission
- Do not perform actions that could harm the availability of the service

## Security Considerations for Users

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Private Keys**: Never share or publish private keys generated by this tool
2. **JWKS**: The "JWK Set (Keypair)" output is for local testing only - never publish JWKS containing private keys
3. **Certificate Validation**: Always verify certificate chains and CRL status through official channels
4. **Browser Security**: Use an up-to-date browser with security features enabled

### Limitations

- This tool is intended for development and testing purposes
- For production cryptographic operations, consider dedicated security hardware or services
- Certificate validation displays structural information but doesn't verify trust chains
- JWT verification validates signatures but doesn't check token validity policies

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Standards

- Uses browser-native Web Crypto API for all operations
- Supports industry-standard algorithms:
  - RSA: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, RSA-PSS, RSA-OAEP
  - Elliptic Curve: P-256, P-384, P-521
  - JWT: RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512

### Data Handling

- All operations performed in browser memory
- No network requests for cryptographic operations
- No cookies or persistent storage used
- Auto-extraction from X.509 certificates uses standard ASN.1 parsing

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as safely possible
- Documented in release notes with severity levels
- Announced through GitHub releases and security advisories

Thank you for helping keep CryptoForge secure!
